# 2D_to_3D_Converter_using_MiDas_Open3Ds

## This process is about convering 2d image to 3d cloud points
## Done using MiDas (models for computing relative depth from a single image) which converts the 2d image to depth map 
## and the 3d map is fed as input to Open3D which converts depth map and RGB image to 3d cloud points
